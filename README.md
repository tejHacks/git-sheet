# git-sheet
### GIT SHEET

### A SMALL WEB BASED APP THAT CONTAINS A FEW GIT AND GITHUB COMMANDS FOR DEVELOPERS
### ITS CONNECTED TO A SMALL BACKEND SYSTEM FOR KEEPING YOUR OWN SHORTCUTS TOO::
### YOU CAN RUN LOCALLY ON YOUR SYSTEM 
### I CREATED THIS ON A LINUX SYSTEM AND I WANTED TO USE PHP TO CREATE THIS
##### Ill see how it goes,first commit today though ,its just a few days before school resumes again and tbh,I would have written this in react but then,Lets see how this is gonna go with just pure PHP::
##### the sample page is just a basic page but this simple one works well without the php though,but the php coded part allows the user to create and add his or her own shortcuts and commands
